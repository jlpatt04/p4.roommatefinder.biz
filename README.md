p4.roommatefinder.biz
=====================


My application is a roommate finder for new residents to Boston. The user fills out a preference form
where he or she indicates the neighborhood, rent range, age, gender, etc. I use this information to run queries determining
the best roommate options. Right now I have two queries. The first one display's the user's information he or she
has entered in the form. The second(more advanced) queries the database looking for roommates who has the same
rent range and have at least 1 common neighborhood choice. I would like to eventually add more queries and allow the
user to select his or her query based on which preferences are most important to him or her. I spent a lot of time on the
database(populating the database) so I could have search results for every user.

Javascript--I am using Javascript for my buttons(click function) and also use it in the slideshow JQUERY plugin I am using
for the index page. I am also using it for error checking for my preference form.
